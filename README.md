# IAC
This repository is for team code merging.
All of team members, please note:
1. Don't pull project that contains any large images whose sizes exceed 100MB. If you do that, github will show errors and it's troublesome to solve this.
2. All of data including images can be stored in a directory named 'IAC_data', which shares the same directory with the 'IAC' directory on your PC. By doing this, it will be easier to pull&push when we update the project.
